# Delivery
 A Business Intelligence Project applied on a dataset called "Delivery". This project was executed using Python and PostgreSQL. 
 
The dataset "Delivery" is represented in two files : a csv file called "Livraisons.csv" and a txt file called "pays.txt". For each id country present in "Livraisons.csv", in "pays.txt" we find the name of the country associated to it.

In order to create this project, the Python libraries used are : 
  - Pandas
  - Atoti
  - Psycopg2
 
 
The goal of this project is to create a Data Warehouse in order to create dashboards that help decision-making for the dataset "Delivery".
